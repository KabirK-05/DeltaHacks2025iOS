# **RecycloBot 🌍♻️**  
**DeltaHacks 11 | McMaster University**  
Team: Karl-Alexandre Michaud, Kabir Kumar, Aaron Ren, Dharav Shah

RecycloBot is an innovative project combining hardware and software to promote eco-friendly habits and waste management awareness. Designed and built during DeltaHacks 11, this project features a smart trash bin powered by Arduino and an iOS app developed with Swift and SwiftUI. Together, they aim to make recycling and waste management more engaging, accessible, and educational for users.  

Our mission is to inspire individuals to take steps toward a greener planet by providing tools to track, learn, and compete in adopting environmentally mindful habits.
